# IPAIPA - Beer and drinks application
IPAIPA is a school work project, my submission to Fullstack Developement laboratory course. App itself is intend to private use for me and several of my friends to make notes about beers and other alchohol beverages, to share recommendations about them and to some extent rate them. 

This repository contains backend and documentation for the IPAIPA beer and drinks application. Code for frontend is located in another repository.
